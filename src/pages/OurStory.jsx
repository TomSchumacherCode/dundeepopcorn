      <h3>What is Dundee Popcorn?
Hi!  I’m Ericka.  I’m the owner of Dundee Popcorn.  

I’ve been making homemade popcorn for years.  I started creating my own recipes after I opened up a bag of store-bought microwave popcorn and took a good hard look at what was inside.  It looked gross.  It didn’t look anything like butter—because it wasn’t butter.  I found a way to put my recipes in a microwave popcorn bag, and Dundee Popcorn was born.  

When you buy our brand, you can be assured that you’re always getting the real deal.  Not butter flavor.  Just butter.  Always.  Our flavors are delicious and always no-fuss.  No extra steps or seasoning packets.  Just put you bag in the microwave and boom - you have a hot and delicious snack that you and your whole family will love.

All of our food and packaging is proudly MADE IN THE USA</h3>
